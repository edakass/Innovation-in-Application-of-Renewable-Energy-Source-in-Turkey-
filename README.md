Turkey has the opportunity to benefit from all renewable energy sources due to its geographical location and geopolitical structure. Especially compared to EU countries in terms of hydraulic, geothermal, wind and solar energy potentials, It is seen that Turkey has a very favorable position. However, the rate of use of these resources is low.

Control Questions

1.Which example was using a thermostat?

2.What was a cloud computing service to calculate 24-Hour production forecasts with high accuracy using wind power plants?

Answers
1.Cosa
2.HyperCFD


Business idea

Solar energy should be used in all street lamps. Solar energy should be stored when the weather is good, and normal situations should be switched to when there is no benefit from solar energy.
Or some roads are also walked a lot or they are passed a lot, by using motion energy and wind energy, the lamps can be used both from the sun, the wind and the motion energy to help the lamps to work continuously and permanently.

Summary
In short,Using the examples given, technology and artificial intelligence, we examined the studies made from renewable energy.
I was able to show these examples by eliminating the previous studies for renewable energy.
